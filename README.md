# Tetris Revamped

Tetris Revamped(TR) is a clone of the original Tetris,
with main focus on the portable version which was bundled with Gameboy in 1989.

---

## Setting up

Unfortunetly there is no executable file available still, but to run TR we first have to install the pygame module which can be done in the following way (assuming you have python3 and pip already installed):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

or if you prefer

    $ pip install pygame

Last tested with `python 3.11.3` & `pygame 2.5.0`

---

## Getting started

After the requirements have been installed the only thing you need to do is run tetris.py

    $ python tetris.py

or

    $ python3 tetris.py

---

## Gameplay

When the game has started the first thing you see is the Title screen.

At this stage, there is no 2 player mode but that is something we are working on.
